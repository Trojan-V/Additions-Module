# Additions-Module
Module/Extension for MacroMod for Minecraft

Hello everyone, this is the first official release of my Additions Module which adds tons of functionality to MacroMod.
As this build is only tested by myself, some bugs may appear. I am thankful to anyone who reports an issue to me, either through Discord or by creating an issue thread here on this GitHub page.

Note: I am planning to create documentation at some point (ideally this should be in form of a website, but to be able to create and release docs within a reasonable amount of time, this will be a normal document at first), but that will take me at least one or two month, so please refer to the source code to see how an action works until more reliable docs have been created.

Anyways, I am highly looking forward to feedback!
Have fun using my module!
